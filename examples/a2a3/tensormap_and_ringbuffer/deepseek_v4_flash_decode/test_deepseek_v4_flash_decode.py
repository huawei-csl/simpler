"""Hardware ST for examples/a2a3/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/deepseek_v4_flash_decode.

The case is manual: Per-PR CI runs it in the dedicated `st-deepseek-onboard-a2a3`
job instead of the main sweep. To run it explicitly:

    python -m pytest examples/a2a3/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/deepseek_v4_flash_decode \\
        --platform a2a3 --manual only --device <d0>,<d1>

``main.py`` is loaded by path, not as ``.main``: the host_build_graph case's
directory has the same name, so a package-relative import would resolve one
case's driver from the other's package.
