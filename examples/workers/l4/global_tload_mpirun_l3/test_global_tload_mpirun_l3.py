"""Network1 ST for examples/workers/l4/global_tload_mpirun_l3.

Runs the real two-machine mpirun path on the network1 pair: one ``mpirun`` from
the parent machine launches an L3 rank per machine, the parent dispatches a
TLOAD task per NPU device on each machine, and the full-group
``a3-fabric-v1`` Global CommDomain built over the MPI descriptor exchange
carries the cross-machine peer reads.

On top of the standard network1 runner environment this test needs ``mpirun`` +
``mpi4py`` on both machines and ``NETWORK1_MPI_PYTHON``: one absolute path, valid
on BOTH machines, of a per-machine launcher that sources CANN, enters that
machine's copy of this run's tree, and execs its ``.venv`` python (a single
``mpirun`` command line launches every rank, so the interpreter path and the
rank-side ``examples...`` import must resolve on each machine).
