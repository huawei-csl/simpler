"""dep_gen host-direct capture test for a5 host_build_graph.

Runs the ``vector_example`` orchestration with ``--enable-dep-gen`` and asserts
the 4 creator edges it declares come out. host_build_graph orchestrates on the
host, so its graph is captured from the orchestrator's own dependency path
rather than replayed from a device ring; the device-orch answer for the same
orchestration is covered by the tensormap_and_ringbuffer dep_gen test, which is
what makes a divergence visible.

Compute correctness is delegated to the upstream ``vector_example`` test; this
case re-uses the orchestration purely to keep coverage on the capture pipeline.
