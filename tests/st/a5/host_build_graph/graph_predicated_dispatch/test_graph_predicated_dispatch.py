"""graph_predicated_dispatch: a Graph carries dispatch predicates across replays.

One fixed Graph body holds three predicated tasks, one per operand source
(boundary tensor, Graph-internal tensor, view of a boundary tensor). The body is
invoked four times: invocation 0 records the Definition, the rest replay it as
outer Graph tasks.

Each invocation supplies its own gate buffer and its own gate scalar:

  invocation | gate[0] | internal | gate[view] | dispatched         | X     | Y
  0          | 0       | 0        | 1          | consumer           | 42.0  | 42.0
  1          | 1       | 0        | 1          | clobber + consumer | 999.0 | 999.0
  2          | 0       | 1        | 1          | alt + consumer     | 555.0 | 555.0
  3          | 0       | 0        | 0          | none               | 42.0  | INIT

An operand address frozen at record time would replay invocation 0's gates, so
every invocation would take invocation 0's branch.

The consumer's operand is a view of the gate starting at GATE_VIEW_BASE, indexed
at element 1 — the only case where the address stacks a boundary base, a view
offset and an element offset. Only gate[GATE_VIEW_BASE + 1] carries its value, so
dropping any one of the three reads an element that is 0 everywhere and leaves Y
unwritten where the table says it must be copied.
