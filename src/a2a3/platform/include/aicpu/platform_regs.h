/**
 * @file platform_regs.h
 * @brief Platform-level register access interface for AICPU
 *
 * Provides unified interface for:
 * 1. Platform register base address management (set/get_platform_regs)
 * 2. Register read/write operations (read_reg/write_reg)
 *
 * The platform layer calls set_platform_regs() before aicpu_execute(),
 * and runtime code calls get_platform_regs() and read_reg/write_reg()
 * for register communication with AICore.
 *
 * Implementation: src/platform/shared/aicpu/platform_regs.cpp (shared across all platforms)
