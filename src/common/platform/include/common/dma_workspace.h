/**
 * Async-DMA engine workspace kinds.
 *
 * The runtime provisions a per-device scratch workspace and injects the device
 * addresses into every core's GlobalContext, so kernels obtain them via
 * get_dma_workspace(args, kind) without threading them as user args. Selecting
 * an engine is the kernel's decision, not the runtime's: every provisioned
 * address is injected, and a kind the runtime did not provision reads back 0.
 * One slot per engine, indexed by this enum; DMA_WORKSPACE_KIND_COUNT sizes the
 * injected array end to end (InitArgs, the resident AICPU config, and
 * GlobalContext).
 *
 * simpler-owned and deliberately independent of pto-isa's comm::DmaEngine —
 * the kernel maps this kind to the pto-isa engine tag at the call boundary.
 * Shared by host (provisioning + InitArgs) and device (scheduler + kernels),
 * so it carries no dependencies beyond the enum itself.
 *
 * A Worker provisions an engine only when it both requested that engine and the
 * device supports it (dma_workspace_supported_mask()), so an unrequested or
 * unsupported kind stays 0. SDMA is the only engine anyone declines today, and
 * the only one worth declining: provisioning it is inseparable from holding 48
 * CP-process STARS streams whose post-fault release CANN bounds neither with a
 * completion fence nor with a portable timeout — see
 * docs/investigations/2026-07-a2a3-sdma-fault-teardown.md. A Worker declines it
 * by leaving `enable_sdma` off, which is the default.
 *
 * Current support matrix: the a2a3 onboard PTO-SDMA provider is compiled into
 * every a2a3 onboard host_runtime, so both runtimes there provision SDMA on
 * request — the gate is the platform, not the runtime. Only
 * tensormap_and_ringbuffer is exercised with it, so host-build-graph's path from
 * a provisioned address to a kernel's get_dma_workspace is unverified rather
 * than closed. URMA is reserved for the future a5 per-domain provider.
 * Simulation, a5, and builds without the a2a3 PTO-SDMA provider reject a request
 * for SDMA during Worker initialization, when the workspace would be
 * provisioned.
