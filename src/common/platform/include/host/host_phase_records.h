/**
 * Pool of host phase records, written on host_build_graph's prepare path and read
 * by whichever diagnostics are enabled for the run.
 *
 * The pool is a platform resource with two independently gated readers — the
 * chip-swimlane export at level 4, and the per-event artifact the host trace
 * tooling consumes — so it belongs to neither of them. Storage and lifetime are
 * the platform's.
 *
 * Recording is a header-inline store into platform-allocated memory rather than
 * a call through HostApi: a pass performs a few hundred operations a few
 * microseconds apart on the very path whose budget is under measurement, so the
 * per-event cost must stay at two clock reads, one slot claim and a store.
 * HostApi carries only the once-per-pass arm and finish.
 *
 * Every producer thread of a pass writes concurrently — a Graph workload records
 * one thread per concurrent Definition alongside the submitting thread — so the
 * pool is a flat array of slots claimed by one atomic increment, not a rotating
 * active buffer. See `host_phase_pool_append` for what that replaced and why.
 */

/**
 * Record storage for one pass, written by every producer thread concurrently.
 *
 * A producer claims a whole buffer and fills it alone, so its records are
 * contiguous and no cache line is ever shared with another producer's record.
 * That is the whole design: the producers are independent — each records its own
 * Definition and counts only its own operations — so nothing about a record needs
 * coordination, and the per-record path has no shared write at all.
 *
 * `generation` invalidates a producer's cached buffer when a new pass is armed;
 * without it a producer left over from the previous pass would append at its old
 * offset into a buffer `arm()` has already cleared.
 *
 * At namespace scope alongside `HostPhaseRecord` and `HostPhaseRecordBuffer`, so
 * the header-inline producer below and its callers name all three the same way.

 * atomic is a buffer claim, taken once per PLATFORM_HOST_PHASE_RECORDS_PER_BUFFER
 * records, and it measures as free.
 *
 * That matters because all of this runs after the record's own end timestamp, so
 * whatever it costs is invisible except as a gap between two records. The
 * predecessor -- a global mutex over one shared active buffer -- cost the emitting
 * thread 3.3 us per record at eight producers against 0.1 us at one, and a flat
 * per-record slot claim still cost 1.1 us because a 40-byte record leaves adjacent
 * slots, owned by different threads, sharing a cache line. Per-producer buffers
 * are flat at ~50 ns from one producer to sixteen, which is what two
 * `clock_gettime` calls cost on their own.
 *
 * A written record is visible to a reader only after that producer stops, so a
 * reader must not read a pass before its producers are done.
